            <h1>What is Environmental Conservation?</h1>
        </center>
        <p class="Para1">Environmental conservation is the practice of preserving the natural world to prevent it
            from collapsing because of human activities, such as unsustainable agriculture, deforestation and burning
            fossil fuels.<br>
            Side effects of these practices include toxic air, plastic pollution, destruction of natural habitats and
            climate change.<br>
            Scientists warn that if we don’t act soon, this will lead to an increase in natural
            disasters, rising sea levels and extreme weather, resulting in collapsed ecosystems, mass extinction of
            wildlife, food scarcity and global displacement of people.<br>
            This is a very scary thought.
            Yet as a community of travelers, we hold a deep appreciation for the natural world and want to experience it
            in a way
            that is responsible, sustainable, and meaningful.<br>
            As volunteers, we see first-hand how collective individual effort an important catalyst for significant
            global change is.<br>
            Environemental Conservation is of 3 types;
        <ul class="Typs">
            <li>Tree Conservation</li>
            <li>Animal Conservation</li>
            <li>Marine Conservation</li>

                Tree conservation is the preservation and management of forests and, by extension, individual trees. It
                is a
                principle, a policy, and a practice, all of which have become more common and popular in the decades of
                the
                late 20th and early 21st centuries.
                In many parts of the world, activists, governments, and conservation
                organizations have done their best to inform people that the natural resource represented by trees and
                forests has great value to civilization, wildlife, and the overall well-being of the world's ecosystems,
                as
                well as potentially influencing climate and the use and conservation of other natural resources. Tree
                conservation is often at odds with the interests of for profit companies that exploit forests for
                natural
                resources as well as those who clear forests for the purpose of agriculture or other land use that
                requires
                the trees to be removed.The primary goal of tree conservation is to preserve and protect forests. The
                reasons for this are many, including the preservation of wildlife habitat, prevention of erosion, and
                preservation of beauty for the enjoyment of future generations.The world's forests are responsible for
                recycling a great deal of the carbon dioxide released into the air by animals, metabolizing it, and
                releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. This cycle is integral to the survival of all life on earth. It
                may
                also influence global climate as some scientists believe that increased deforestation could contribute
                to
                global warming. Trees also filter out pollutants from our air, helping to preserve air quality and,
                therefore, our health.

            <p class="animal-article">Animal conservation is the act of protecting ecosystems and environments to
                protect the animals
                that live there.

                The importance of animal conservation is immeasurable, at a time where our planet is currently
                experiencing
                the sixth major extinction event in the 3.6 billion years that life has been on it. This is also the
                first
                extinction event caused by humans and the only one to occur since the dinosaurs were wiped out some 65
                million years ago. This is at a time where the rubbish path in the Pacific ocean is larger than the
                U.S.A
                and where baby birds swallow more shards of plastic than nutritious food!

                But without trying to scare you away…there is also a lot of positive work beginning to show great
                results.
                From the downgrading of the snow leopard from ‘endangered’ to ‘vulnerable’ by the ICUN to the successful
                red
                squirrel conservation projects going on all over the UK, animal conservation is on our doorsteps and is
                happening all around us. Animal conservation also gives the unique opportunity to travel the world –
                conservation in the UK is very different to animal conservation abroad. Projects and animal conservation
                societies are being set up and developed all over the world every day, and along with that comes the
                urgent
                need for animal conservation volunteers and science specialists.</p>

            <p class="marine-article">Marine conservation, also known as ocean conservation, is the protection and
                preservation of ecosystems in
                oceans and seas through planned management in order to prevent the over-exploitation of these resources.
                Marine conservation is informed by the study of marine plants and animal resources and ecosystem
                functions
                and is driven by response to the manifested negative effects seen in the environment such as species
                loss,
                habitat degradation and changes in ecosystem functions and focuses on limiting human-caused damage to
                marine ecosystems, restoring damaged marine ecosystems, and preserving vulnerable species and ecosystems
                of
                the marine life. Marine conservation is a relatively new discipline which has developed as a response to
                biological issues such as extinction and marine habitats change.Marine conservationists rely on a
                combination of scientific principles derived from marine biology, Ecology, oceanography, and fisheries
                science, as well as on human factors, such as demand for marine resources, maritime law, economics, and
                policy, in order to determine how to best protect and conserve marine species and ecosystems. Marine
                conservation may be described as a sub-discipline of conservation biology. Marine conservation has been
                addressed in sustainable development goal 14 that ensures sustainable use of marine resources for
                sustainable development.
